# DesignPatterns

## Strategy
This is a simple application which compare execution time of sorting algorithms. To do this task I implemented strategy design pattern so adding new sorting algorithm is very simple. All you have to do is add new class which implements Strategy interface.

In this example we compare three algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort and quicksort. To create charts we used Java Swing With JFreeChart. In following chart X axis is array size and Y axis is execution time.
